			<p>Often smaller places get overlook and perhaps aren't appreciated as much as larger more popular areas. However taking a break from city life can be cruicial in unwinding from work, so why not take a few days here and there and explore somewhere you may not have concidered? Just a thought.</p>
			<p>Boston is in the middle of some very popular holiday destinations so it may be worth a quick drive or stop-by in the town to see what it has to offer as it may suprise you. There are a couple of animal famrs near by, acres of fields and fresh air, a parrot sanctuary, a bubble car museum and much much more.</p>
